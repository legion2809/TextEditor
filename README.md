# TextEditor
Simple text editor written on C#

Hello, GitHub users! That is my compilation of classic Windows Notepad, actually.

What it can do?:
1) Correctly open, create and save .txt files
2) Cut, copy, paste, select all text and delete selected text (by shortcut keys or by menu on editor GUI).
3) Undo and redo recent actions (I wrote these functions separately because they need to be improved).

Changes/fixes log:
1) Fixed a problem with undo/redo

You can download it by this link: https://github.com/legion2809/TextEditor/releases

Good luck :)
